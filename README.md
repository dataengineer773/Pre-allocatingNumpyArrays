We need	to	pre-allocate	arrays	of	a	given	size	with	some	value, for this issue  NumPy	has	functions	for	generating	vectors	and	matrices	of	any	size	using	0s,	1s,	or	values	of	your
 choice and  Generating	arrays	prefilled	with	data	is	useful	for	a	number	of	purposes,	such	as	making	code	more  performant	or	having	synthetic	data	to	test	algorithms	with.	In	many	programming	languages,	pre
 performant	an	array	of	default	values	(such	as	0s)	is	considered	common	practice.
